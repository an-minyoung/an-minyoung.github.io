My name is Minyoung An, a PhD candidate at the school of sociology, University of Arizona. 

My research examines how gender, both as an individual attribute and as an institutional force, shapes decision-making processes and in turn, perpetuates social inequality. I investigate this intersecting multilevel force to explore a spectrum of individual choicesâ€”from explicit life path decisions such as migration and educational pursuits, to implicit processes of identity formation, including political partisanship and ideologies. 

To explore such inquiries, I deploy a wide variety of methods, including quantitative methods, computational methods, and in-depth interviews.
